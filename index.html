      <h1>Cooking</h1>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <p>
        Most ingredients in cooking are derived from living organisms.
        Vegetables, fruits, grains and nuts as well as herbs and spices come
        from plants, while meat, eggs, and dairy products come from animals.
        Mushrooms and the yeast used in baking are kinds of fungi. Cooks also
        use water and minerals such as salt. Cooks can also use wine or spirits.
        Naturally occurring ingredients contain various amounts of molecules
        called proteins, carbohydrates and fats. They also contain water and
        minerals. Cooking involves a manipulation of the chemical properties of
        these molecules. <br /><br /><strong>Carbohydrate</strong> <br />
        Carbohydrates include the common sugar, sucrose <em>(table sugar)</em>,
        a disaccharide, and such simple sugars as glucose (made by enzymatic
        splitting of sucrose) and fructose (from fruit), and starches from
        sources such as cereal flour, rice, arrowroot and potato.[17] The
        interaction of heat and carbohydrate is complex. Long-chain sugars such
        as starch tend to break down into more digestible simpler sugars.[18] If
        the sugars are heated so that all water of crystallisation is driven
        off, caramelization starts, with the sugar undergoing thermal
        decomposition with the formation of carbon, and other breakdown products
        producing caramel. Similarly, the heating of sugars and proteins causes
        the Maillard reaction, a basic flavor-enhancing technique. An emulsion
        of starch with fat or water can, when gently heated, provide thickening
        to the dish being cooked. In European cooking, a mixture of butter and
        flour called a roux is used to thicken liquids to make stews or
        sauces.[19] In Asian cooking, a similar effect is obtained from a
        mixture of rice or corn starch and water. These techniques rely on the
        properties of starches to create simpler mucilaginous saccharides during
        cooking, which causes the familiar thickening of sauces. This thickening
        will break down, however, under additional heat. <br /><br />

        <strong>Fat</strong> <br />
        Doughnuts frying in oil Types of fat include vegetable oils, animal
        products such as butter and lard, as well as fats from grains, including
        maize and flax oils. Fats are used in a number of ways in cooking and
        baking. To prepare stir fries, grilled cheese or pancakes, the pan or
        griddle is often coated with fat or oil. Fats are also used as an
        ingredient in baked goods such as cookies, cakes and pies. Fats can
        reach temperatures higher than the boiling point of water, and are often
        used to conduct high heat to other ingredients, such as in frying, deep
        frying or sautéing. Fats are used to add flavor to food (e.g., butter or
        bacon fat), prevent food from sticking to pans and create a desirable
        texture. Proteins Main articles: Protein (nutrient) and Protein
        denaturation Edible animal material, including muscle, offal, milk, eggs
        and egg whites, contains substantial amounts of protein. Almost all
        vegetable matter (in particular legumes and seeds) also includes
        proteins, although generally in smaller amounts. Mushrooms have high
        protein content. Any of these may be sources of essential amino acids.
        When proteins are heated they become denatured (unfolded) and change
        texture. In many cases, this causes the structure of the material to
        become softer or more friable – meat becomes cooked and is more friable
        and less flexible. In some cases, proteins can form more rigid
        structures, such as the coagulation of albumen in egg whites. The
        formation of a relatively rigid but flexible matrix from egg white
        provides an important component in baking cakes, and also underpins many
        desserts based on meringue.<br><br>
        <strong>Security while cooking</strong>
        <br>
        Hazards while cooking can include:

        <ul>
            <li>Unseen slippery surfaces (such as from oil stains, water droplets, or items that have fallen on the floor)</li>
            <li>Cuts; about a third of the US's estimated annual 400,000 knife injuries are kitchen-related.[24]</li>
            <li>Burns or fires</li>
        </ul>

        To prevent those injuries there are protections such as cooking clothing, anti-slip shoes, fire extinguisher and more.
